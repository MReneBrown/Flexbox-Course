        /* If you remember back to the last guide if I remove this column definition 
        and just went with the default of row and in fact lets just change it to row 
        just so you can see that it's clearly using this row style here. We got that 
        very odd behavior where everything just got squished up together. The reason 
        for this is it deals directly because we're using two flex containers here 
        and so we are not able to use a row if we have a row used up here in our 
        container. So we have this nested containers situation where we have 1 flex 
        container that holds another flex container. If we use row and then the 
        combination of all these other styles here then we're going to end up with a 
        very odd page. So the way to fix this is to change the Flex direction here. 
         instead of using the default row now we can say column and if I save this 
         now you can see we get the behavior that you'd expect.*/
